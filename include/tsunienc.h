 *  Returns the next Unicode character that is encoded in a UTF8 text array.

 *  Description:
 *      This function returns a single UTF32 Unicode value that has been

 *
 *      Each successful call will consume 1 to 4 code units (bytes)

 *      
 *      If srclen is too short to decode the next character then
 *      the function returns the value FFFD, which is the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER
 *      and consumed returns the number of bytes consumed to that point.
 *
 *  Parameters:
 *      source      - [in] pointer to UTF8 text
 *      srclen      - [in] length of source in code units
 *      consumed    - [out] returns the number of code units that are consumed
 *                          in getting this character

 *  Description:
 *      This function returns a single UTF32 Unicode value that has been

 *
 *      Each successful call will consume 1 to 2 code units (UInt16)
 *      depending on the character that is encoded.
 *      
 *      If srclen is too short to decode the next character then

 *      and consumed is returned as 1.
 *
 *      If the first character indicates that the character is a surrogate
 *      then the second code unit is looked first verified. If it is an invalid low
 *      surrogate value then the function returns the REPLACMENT_CHARACTER
 *      and consumed is returned as 1.

 *      source      - [in] pointer to UTF8 text
 *      srclen      - [in] length of source in code units
